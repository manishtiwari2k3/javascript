<!-- object oriented programming in javascript -->

javascript is basically a prototype based language

classes are there in javascript but it is just a syntactic sugar  -> behind the scene there is inheritance based prototyping and thats it


<!-- oops -->

object oriented programming -> this is just an programming paradigm which meaans that it is just a style to write the code in the language thats it, It is just a way of writing the code, it can be object oriented, procedural oriented etc.

<!-- objects -->

objects are a collection of propertes and methods
for example -> toUpperCase


<!-- why do we use OOP -->
because of the spaghetti code -> code itna jyada messy ho jata tha ki use understand karna muskil ho jata tha thats why it is better to write the code in the term of classes and objects for the better understanding of the code and made code easier to understand

<!-- parts of object -->

1 -> object literal
2-> constructor function
3-> prototype
4-> classes
5-> instances (new,this,etc.)


<!--  4 pillars of oops->

encapsulation
inhertance
polymorphism
abstraction      ex-> fetch
